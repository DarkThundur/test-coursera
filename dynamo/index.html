<h1 class='Header'>What is a Dynamo?</h1>
<p class='Info'>It is a device which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.</p>
<h1 class="Header">How does it work?</h1>
<p class="Info">The dynamo works via using electromagnetic induction.</p>
<p class='Info'>In electromagnetic induction a magnetic field is moved relative to a conductor thus producing a voltage.</p>
<p class=Info>In our dynamo a magnet is rotated around coils of wire generating an AC current.<p>
<p class='Info'> It generates AC current as the north and south poles are constantly changing relative to the coils.<p>
<h1 class='Header'>Where can a dynamo be used</h1>
<section id='UIs'>

	<li>In speed bumpers to generate current from moving car wheels</li>
	<li>In bicycle wheels to power the bicycle lights</li>
	<li>As a generator to generate electricity for usage</li>
	<li>Used in handcranked torch lights </li>
	<li>Used to charge batteries and mobile phones (human powered chargers)</li>
